Interface
-----------

why we need?

   --> To avoid tight-coupling between objects.
   
   --> To provide 100% abstraction of Object to Other.
   
   --> To relate different objects with common behav.
   
   --> For Multiple inheritance in java.


--------------------------------


  Imp notes :
  
       --> For interface we cant create Instance but we can
           create reference var.
           
       --> By default all methods are public,abstract methods.
       
       --> by default all variables are public,static,final
       
       --> One Interface can extend many interfaces.
       
       Recom: Keep all interfaces in separate packages.

     Abstract-Class Vs Interface
     ---------------------------
     
	Abstract Class                                    Interface     
  
  
    No multiple inheritance					Yes			
  
    Re-usable Behav                                             No
    
    Partial Abstraction						100%
    
    Instance/static - static/dynamic var 			static/Constant
    
    Constructor							No
    
    Good for related classes                            Related/un-related
    
    not Best for loose-coupling					  loose-coupling
