Constructor:
-----------

 use: To initialize/construct object variables with values
      when obj being created.


   In Java , Obj creation
   -------------------------
   
   2 steps
   
   1. Runtime memory allocation: --> new
   
   2. Initialize that memory with Obj's values --> constructor
   
   
   Notes:
   
   
   --> Every Java class has one 'default constructor' if
       no constructor defined by programmer.
       
  --> 'D.C' will put default values to Obj variables when no values
       supplied by programmer.   
       
  --> To create any class's object with mandatory attribute values,
      then override default constructor with Arg Cons.
      
      
  --> If there is arg cons, the compiler will not place default cons.
  
  
  
  --> To create same type of Object in different way, use
      'Constructor Overloading'.
      
      
      Rules for Constructor Overloading:
      ----------------------------------
      
      1. Must be same
      
          --> Constructor Name
      
     2. Must be different in
     
     	--> Type of args
     	    or
        --> Number of args
            or
        --> Order of args    	    
      
     3. May different in
     
        --> Access specifiers.
      
      
   =================================
   
   
   'this' keyword   
   ----------------
   
   It will hold reference of current obj which being running in
   class.
   
   use:
   ----
   
   --> To differentiate Obj var names from cons arg names when
       they are same to assign.
       
   --> To invoke overloaded constructor for current object.
